# Local Search Methods for the One-Sided Cross Minimisation Problem

This repository contains the code for an article called *Local Search Methods for the One-Sided Cross Minimisation Problem*. All code has been implemented within Jupyter Notebooks with SageMath 9.5 kernels and Python 3.10. An introduction to the problem is provided in `OSCM_Introduction.ipynb` and the algorithms presented are provided in `OSCM_Local_Search.ipynb`. Each notebook is self-contained. The article is available [HERE](https://drive.proton.me/urls/ZZ4GWWQJXM#5890rmTgPpJT).

- The base graph class used throughout the project is a heavily modified version of the class used in the [PACE Challenge verifier](https://pypi.org/project/pace2024-verifier/) package.
- Outside of standard library modules for Python and SageMath, the [segment-tree](https://github.com/evgeth/segment_tree) package is required. This may be installed by running `sage --pip install segment-tree`.
